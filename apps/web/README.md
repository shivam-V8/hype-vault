This folder contains the LP-facing Next.js App Router experience for the Hyper Vault.

## Local development

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the UI. Tailwind CSS (v4) is configured via `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and the layout uses `wagmi` + `viem` to read Hyper-EVM data.

## Environment variables

The UI relies on the following vars:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYPER_EVM_RPC` – on-chain JSON-RPC URL (default: `https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULT_ADDRESS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_RISK_MANAGER_ADDRESS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS` – Hyper-EVM contract addresses.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS` – USDC token address the vault accepts.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_DECIMALS` – decimals for the vault asset (default: `6`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` – optional WalletConnect v2 project ID for alternative connectors.
- `HYPERLIQUID_TRADER` – vault trader address used by serverless APIs (fallback: `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYPERLIQUID_TRADER`).

The UI expects `bot.db` (generated by the bot in the repo root) to exist because the `/api/vault/activity` route reads execution history directly from that SQLite file.

## API routes

- `GET /api/hyperliquid` – server-side fetch of Hyperliquid `clearinghouseState` and `userFills` for the configured trader. The response is polled from the dashboard, positions, and activity pages.
- `GET /api/vault/activity` – reads Vault `Deposit`/`Withdraw`/`IntentExecuted` logs plus the last 10 bot executions from `bot.db`.

## Feature summary

- Landing page introduces the Vault, roadmap, and high-level trust model.
- Dashboard shows TVL, exposure, vault status (active vs. paused), and Hyperliquid account data.
- Deposit/Withdraw page wires `approve`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` transactions via `wagmi` for connected wallets.
- Positions page displays Hyperliquid asset positions and PnL.
- Activity page maps on-chain Vault events and execution rows from the bot database.

## Building & deploying

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The project can be deployed anywhere Next.js (App Router) is supported. Ensure the environment variables above are provided and that `bot.db` remains accessible for the activity feed.
